# Project-Days-Calendar

The Days Calendar is a web application that dynamically displays a calendar for the current month, highlighting specific commemorative days that occur annually on varying dates. For example, Ada Lovelace Day is observed on the second Tuesday of every October. The application reads data from a provided JSON file to identify these special days and highlights them on the calendar.

**Key Features**:

Dynamic Calendar Generation: The application generates a calendar for the current month, displaying each day as a rectangle.

Navigation Controls: Users can navigate to the previous and next months using dedicated buttons.

Month and Year Selector: A selector allows users to jump to a specific month and year.

Commemorative Day Highlights: Days specified in the JSON file are highlighted on the calendar.

How It Works:

*Date Calculation*: For each commemorative day, the application calculates the specific date for the current year.

*Calendar Rendering*: The calendar for the current month is rendered, with each day displayed as a rectangle.

Highlighting Special Days: Days that match the calculated dates of commemorative days are highlighted on the calendar.

*User Interaction*: Users can navigate through months and years, with the calendar updating accordingly.

**Technologies Used**:

*HTML/CSS*: For structuring and styling the calendar.

*JavaScript*: For dynamic functionality, including date calculations and DOM manipulation.

*JSON*: For storing and retrieving data about commemorative days.

This application provides an interactive way to explore and learn about various commemorative days throughout the year.
